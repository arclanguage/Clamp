Common Lisp with Arc Procedures

Arc is a language which has many features that make it enjoyable to program in. At the same time it lacks some of the most basic fundamentals of a programming language. It has neither a debugger nor a module system. Clap is an attemp to bring Common Lisp, which has both an amazing debugger and a module system, up to arc's level in succintness and brevity.

Defalias is a macro which allows one to easily give new names to procedures or macros already in common lisp.

For some reason it won't compile if tried to do it all at once. This can be side stepped by loading the different files, but not compiling them, and then compiling the whole thing.
